So this is the collection of aphorisms so far. As you can see, a number of aphorisms grouped together all identify a particular principle such as 'reduce surface area.' Additionally, it tells us how to build, architect design, verify and implement a secure system. Currently, the aphorisms need to be identified as either a principle or a description of a principle. I would then like to identify the correct citation for this principle (if possible), and then document it. Two principles have been identified below. Also Saltzer and Schroeder for example are definitely included.

# Principles

## Reduce Surface Area
  - Fail to a Secure Mode
  - Fail Safe Defaults
  - If You Don't Use It, Disable It
  - Use Secure Defaults

## Reluctance to Trust 
  - Assume All Input Is Malicious
  - Do Not Trust User Input
  - Centralize Input Validation
  - Validate All Values Sent from the Client
  - Assume External Systems Are Insecure
  - Constrain, Reject, And Sanitize Input
  - Do Not Trust HTTP Header Information
  - Never Assuming that your Secrets are Safe
